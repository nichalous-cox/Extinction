		<h2> Description</h2>
		<nav>
			<ul>
				<li>Phorusrhacids, colloquially known as terror birds, are an extinct clade of large carnivorous flightless birds that were the largest species of apex predators in South America during the Cenozoic era; their temporal range covers from 62 to 1.8 million years (Ma) ago.</li>
				<li>Phorusrhacids may have even made their way into Africa; the genus Lavocatavis was recently discovered in Algeria, but its status as a true phorusrhacid is questioned. A possible European form, Eleutherornis, has also been identified, suggesting that this group had a wider geographical range in the Paleogene.</li>
				<li>The closely related bathornithids occupied a similar ecological niche in North America across the Eocene to Miocene; some, like Paracrax, reached similar sizes to the largest phorusrhacids. At least one analysis recovers Bathornis as sister taxa to phorusrhacids, on the basis of shared features in the jaws and coracoid, though this has been seriously contested, as these might have evolved independently for the same carnivorous, flightless lifestyle.</li>

			<h3>Extinction</h3>
			<nav>
				<ul>
					<li>From 27 million years to 2.5 million years ago, there was an increase in the phorusrhacid population size in South America, suggesting that, in that time frame, the various species flourished as predators in the savannah environment.</li>
					<li>The traditional view of phorusrhacid extinction is that, as the Isthmus of Panama emerged, 2.5 million years ago, carnivorous dogs, bears, and cats from North America were able to cross into South America, increasing competition. As the population of phorusrhacids gradually decreased, this suggests that competition with other predators was a major influence on Phorusrhacidae extinction.</li>
					<li> It appears that the Great American Interchange was a much more gradual process than earlier though, beginning well back over ten million years ago in the Miocene, when placental carnivorans like Cyonasua first reached South America. The timing of the predator extinctions also does not correlate well with the arrival of large carnivores like canids or sabretooths, with the vast majority of phorusrhacids, as well as all sparrasodonts, dying out well before the arrival of larger placental carnivores. </li>
